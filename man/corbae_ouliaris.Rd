Corbae-Ouliaris (2006) Frequency Domain Filter
}
\usage{
corbae_ouliaris(x, low_freq = NULL, high_freq = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{
Vector, \code{data.frame}, \code{matrix} or any similar 1D/2D object containing
values for filtering.
}
\item{low_freq}{
Number indicating the lowest period of oscillation as fractions of \eqn{\pi}.
If \code{low_freq > 1}, indicating that the direct frequency of the data is
provided, this is transformed internally into \code{2 / high_freq}. The default
is NULL, meaning that the \code{ifelse(freq > 1, trunc(freq * 1.5), 2)} will be
used.
}
\item{high_freq}{
Number indicating the highest period of oscillation as radians of \eqn{\pi}. If
\code{high_freq > 1}, indicating that the direct frequency of the data is
provided, this is transformed internally into \code{2 / low_freq}. The default
is NULL, meaning that the \code{trunc(freq * 8)} will be used.
}
}
\details{
This is a pure R implementation of the filtering algorithm. \code{low_freq} and
\code{high_freq} are connected with characteristics of the series, for example
the business circle. \code{low_freq} and \code{high_freq} must be both either
between 0 and 1, meaning that they are frequencies of the period as radians, or
both >1, indicating that both are starting and ending periods of the cycle.

\code{low_freq} and \code{high_freq} are used for keeping the relevant
frequencies. These are meant to be the ones inside the range
\eqn{[ low \_ freq, high \_ freq ]}. Therefore, values outside this range are
removed.

For 2-dimensional objects \code{x}, filtering per column is applied.
}

\value{
Filtered object with the same length/dimensions and class as the input x.
